# Portfolio

This project was originally a basic portfolio site from our 2nd week of bootcamp but was repurposed as a later follow-up. The assignment was to take and earlier project and do BAD design that still functions. I took the opportunity to  experiment with CSS variables and controlling them with Javascript.

Thanks to Wes Bos's Javascript 30 (day 3) for the inspiration!
